# Template system

## Features
- Abstraction of `<head>`.
- Abstraction of `<body>`.
- Expansion of HTML components inside pages.
- No dependencies.
- Everything is in a single file.

## Limitations

- No nested components. I think that will need a proper parser.
- Components don't create a scope for styles or scripts.
