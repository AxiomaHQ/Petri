# Template system

## Features
- Abstraction of `<head>`.
- Abstraction of `<body>`.
- Expansion of HTML components inside pages.
- No dependencies.
- Everything is in a single file.
- TODO: Abstract data from templates
- TODO: Control flow constructs

## Limitations

All limitations will be addressed in different experiments for simplicity.

- No nested components. I think that will need a proper parser.
- Components don't create a scope for styles or scripts.
